👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I'm a passionate Chemical Engineering enthusiast leveraging Python to revolutionize process simulation and optimization. My mission is to bridge the gap between chemical engineering principles and cutting-edge computational tools, creating efficient, sustainable, and innovative solutions for industrial processes. 🌱

🔬 What I'm Working On





Integrating Python with Chemical Engineering: Building tools and scripts to model complex chemical processes using libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Pyomo.



Process Simulation: Developing simulations for unit operations (e.g., reactors, distillation columns) and full flowsheets, often integrating with simulators like Aspen Plus or DWSIM via Python APIs.



Optimization: Crafting algorithms to optimize process parameters, reduce energy consumption, and enhance sustainability using techniques like linear programming, nonlinear optimization, and machine learning.



Open-Source Contributions: Sharing reusable code for chemical engineering applications to foster collaboration and innovation in the community.
